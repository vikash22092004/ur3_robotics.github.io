        <h1>UR3 Robot Arm Manipulator</h1>
        <p>The UR3 robot arm, manufactured by Universal Robots, is a collaborative robotic arm known for its compact size and versatility.</p>
        <h2>Key features of the UR3 robot arm include:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>6 Degrees of Freedom (DOF):</strong> The UR3 robot arm has six joints, providing it with six degrees of freedom for flexible and precise movement.
                    <br>- Base rotation
                    <br>- Shoulder rotation
                    <br>- Elbow rotation
                    <br>- Wrist 1 rotation
                    <br>- Wrist 2 rotation
                    <br>- Wrist 3 rotation
            </li><br>
            <li><strong>Compact Design:</strong> With a payload capacity of 3 kg and a reach radius of 500 mm, the UR3 is designed to work in tight spaces and collaborate safely with human workers.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Collaborative Operation:</strong> The UR3 is designed to work safely alongside human operators without the need for safety cages, thanks to built-in force sensing and safety features.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Easy Programming:</strong> The UR3 robot arm can be programmed quickly and easily using intuitive graphical interfaces or scripting languages, allowing for rapid deployment in various applications.</li><br>
            <li><strong>Wide Range of Applications:</strong> The UR3 is suitable for a wide range of applications, including assembly, pick and place, packaging, machine tending, and more.</li><br>
        </ul>
