        <h1>Applying Kinematics</h1>
        <h2>What is Kinematics?</h2>
        <p>Kinematics is a branch of classical mechanics that describes the motion of objects without considering the
            forces that cause the motion. Kinematics allows us to analyze and predict the motion of objects by studying
            their trajectories, speeds, and accelerations without necessarily delving into the underlying causes of that
            motion. It forms the foundation of many areas of physics, including robotics, aerospace engineering, and
            biomechanics.</p>

        <h2>Forward Kinematics</h2>
        <p>Forward kinematics is a method used in robotics and computer graphics to determine the position and
            orientation of the end-effector (such as a robot's hand or tool) based on the known values of joint
            parameters, such as joint angles or lengths. In simpler terms, forward kinematics allows you to calculate
            where the end of a robot arm or any mechanical system will be located based on the positions of its
            individual segments or joints. It's like tracing the path of movement from the base of the system to the
            end.</p>

        <h2>Applying Forward Kinematics</h2>
        <p>Calculating forward kinematics using the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameter table involves a systematic
            approach to model the joint parameters of a robotic manipulator. The DH parameters provide a standardized
            way to represent the kinematic chain of the robot. Here's a step-by-step guide to understanding and
            calculating forward kinematics using DH parameters:</p>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Denavit-Hartenberg Parameters:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>θi (theta): Joint angle — the angle around the Zi-1 axis from the Xi-1 axis to the Xi axis.</li>
                    <li>di (link offset): Distance along the Zi-1 axis from the origin of frame i-1 to the Xi axis.</li>
                    <li>ai (link length): Distance along the Xi axis from the Zi-1 axis to the Zi axis.</li>
                    <li>αi (link twist): Angle around the Xi axis from the Zi-1 axis to the Zi axis.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>A commonly used convention for selecting frames of reference in robotic applications is the
            Denavit-Hartenberg, or D-H convention. In this convention, each homogeneous transformation Ai is represented
            as a product of four basic transformations.</p>

        <h2>Steps to Calculate Forward Kinematics</h2>
        <p><strong>1. Define the DH Parameters:</strong><br>
            The Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters uniquely define each joint's configuration in the robot. For the UR3
            robot, we have six joints, and the DH parameters for each joint include four values: θi, di, ai, and αi.
            These
            parameters describe the position and orientation of one joint relative to the previous one.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Construct Individual Transformation Matrices:</strong><br>
            For each joint, we construct a transformation matrix Ai using the DH parameters. This matrix transforms
            coordinates from the frame of joint i-1 to the frame of joint i. The transformation matrix Ai is built using
            trigonometric functions of θi (the joint angle), and the other parameters di (link offset), ai (link
            length),
            and αi (link twist).</p>

        <p><strong>3. Multiply the Transformation Matrices:</strong><br>
            To find the position and orientation of the end-effector (the tool or gripper at the end of the robot arm),
            we
            need to combine the transformations from each joint. This is done by multiplying the individual
            transformation
            matrices in sequence:<br>
            T = A1 • A2 • A3 • A4 • A5 • A6<br>
            Here, T is the overall transformation matrix that describes the position and orientation of the end-effector
            relative to the base frame of the robot.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Interpretation of the Final Transformation Matrix:</strong><br>
            The final transformation matrix T will be a 4x4 matrix containing:<br>
            • The rotational part (the top-left 3x3 submatrix) which describes the orientation of the end-effector.<br>
            • The translational part (the top-right 3x1 vector) which describes the position of the end-effector in 3D
            space.</p>

        <h2>Inverse Kinematics</h2>
        <p>Inverse kinematics is a technique used in robotics and animation where you start with a desired end position
            (like where you want a robot arm's hand to be) and work backward to figure out the joint angles or positions
            needed to achieve that desired end position. It's like solving a puzzle in reverse, finding out how to move
            the different parts of
            a system to get to a specific final arrangement.</p>

        <h2>Algorithm used to calculate Inverse Kinematics</h2>
        <h3>CCD (Cyclic Coordinate Descent):</h3>
        <p>CCD algorithm iteratively adjusts each joint angle in a chain of joints to minimize the difference between
            the current end-effector position and the desired position.</p>

        <h3>Key Concepts of CCD:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Iterative Optimization:</strong> CCD adjusts one joint at a time in an iterative manner to
                minimize the distance between the current end-effector position and the desired target position.</li>
            <li><strong>Sequential Update:</strong> The algorithm updates each joint angle sequentially. After adjusting
                all joints once, the algorithm starts over from the first joint and repeats the process.</li>
            <li><strong>Simple and Efficient:</strong> CCD is relatively simple to implement and computationally
                efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps in the CCD Algorithm:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Initialize:</strong> Start with an initial guess for the joint angles. This could be the current
                configuration of the robot.</li>
            <li><strong>Iterate Over Joints:</strong> For each joint, starting from the end-effector and moving towards
                the base:
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Compute the Vector to Target:</strong> Calculate the vector from the current joint
                        position to the target position.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compute the Vector to End-Effector:</strong> Calculate the vector from the current joint
                        position to the end-effector position.</li>
                    <li><strong>Calculate the Rotation:</strong> Determine the rotation needed to align the end-effector
                        vector with the target vector.</li>
                    <li><strong>Update Joint Angle:</strong> Adjust the joint angle by the calculated rotation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Repeat:</strong> Repeat the iterative process until the end-effector is sufficiently close to
                the target position or a maximum number of iterations is reached.</li>
        </ol>
